Functionalities:
• Search Images: You will be able to search images in any web services, e.g.,
https://pixabay.com or https://www.pexels.com, from your app. When the searching
happens, you should run the progress bar on the UI. [3 Marks]
• Display images: You will be able to load 15 images from your search if it returns
more than 15 images. Otherwise, just load all the images returned from the search.
Note the search response usually has options for small or thumbnail images. Please
use that for quick loading. The images are displayed, so they are scrollable (You are
open to using any widget, such as RecyclerView). The app user should have the
option to customise the views:
o Single-column view: Only one picture is placed on a row of the scrollable view.
[3 marks]
o Double-column view: Two pictures are placed on a row of the scrollable view.

• Upload image: The user will be able to select an image from the display and will be
able to upload it to online storage (You can choose anything that works for you). This
is a research part, and you are given the freedom to use online codes with proper
references. For example, you can use Google Drive, Dropbox API. My personal
preference is Firebase: https://firebase.google.com [6 marks]
